“Hello, I’m John Smith, nice to meet you. I’m a writer with five years of professional experience in the online content writing industry. My core skill sets are online content writing and social media engineering. I’m endlessly curious and all my colleagues and coworkers look to me for answers – they know that either I know it or I’ll find out. As I’ve always been exceptionally passionate about social issues, I’m looking to write for publications/websites focused on climate change so that I can create content and campaigns urging others to take action and ensure sustainable cacao production for future generations.”
