Hi Andriani,
I am sorry for the trouble in the past 2 months, I have revised the following data missing and incorrect calculations.

I have two reasons for recurrent issues, here some explanations
I think we need more manpower to have this issue completed.In some longer time we have so much data to provide.
In the other side we think the need more powerfull tools to doing some this big data problem.Once again i want to say sorry for this trouble, i hope you understand.

Regards,
Tony Wijaya
